# Welcome to my Devlog!

This is the first entry in my journey to create a game from start to finish — something I’ve always wanted to do, but never fully committed to until now.

After spending 10 years working in automation, production, and the automotive industry, I’ve decided it’s time to shift gears and build something I truly love: **games**.

I’ve dabbled in game development before — building small prototypes and experimenting with mechanics — but this time, my goal is different. I’m not just tinkering. I’m focused on shipping a complete product.

## What I'm Building

I’m developing a systems-driven game with deep, meaningful mechanics. Think of it as a *space-themed twist on Vampire Survivors*, but with a stronger emphasis on **damage calculation, stat interactions, and tactical depth**.

This genre is a great starting point for solo developers: it encourages reusable, modular systems and doesn’t require massive amounts of narrative or asset-heavy content. That means I can focus on crafting tight gameplay and robust underlying systems — which is exactly where my passion lies.

## What to Expect in This Devlog

Here, I’ll share my progress, challenges, and learnings throughout the development process. You can expect posts on:

- **Game systems deep dives** — how I design and implement mechanics like combat, progression, and AI.
- **The business side of indie dev** — drawing from my background in Commercial, Sales, and Costing roles, I’ll explore how to build games sustainably and minimize risk.
- **AI in games** — a personal favorite. I’ll cover topics like State Machines, Behavior Trees, and especially **GOAP (Goal-Oriented Action Planning)** — one of my all-time favorite AI architectures.'

This journey won’t be perfect, but it will be honest. Thanks for stopping by — I’m excited to have you here.

More updates coming soon!
